This folder contains all analysis related to individual samples. We analyzed all samples separatelly and explored the ZAP70 marker within each one. Furthermore you can also find the analysis by sample after removing the T cells from the datasets.

Here you can find a brief description of each script:

S_180574.R: This study involves single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) of patient S_180574. The primary aim is to analyze the gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-cell resolution to identify distinct cell populations and their molecular characteristics. The analysis leverages the Seurat pipeline to perform quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations.

S_210183.R: This study involves single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) of patient S_210183. The primary aim is to analyze the gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-cell resolution to identify distinct cell populations and their molecular characteristics. The analysis leverages the Seurat pipeline to perform quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations.

S_210414.R: This study involves single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) of patient S_210414. The primary aim is to analyze the gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-cell resolution to identify distinct cell populations and their molecular characteristics. The analysis leverages the Seurat pipeline to perform quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations.

S_211855.R: This study involves single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) of patient S_211855. The primary aim is to analyze the gene expression and chromatin accessibility at a single-cell resolution to identify distinct cell populations and their molecular characteristics. The analysis leverages the Seurat pipeline to perform quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various cell populations.
